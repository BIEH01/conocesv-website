        <h1>Conoce+ Terms of Use</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 15, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Conoce+ (“the App”), a digital service operated by Bryan Escamilla. By downloading, installing, or
            using the App, you (“the User”) agree to and are bound by these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy. If you
            do not agree, you must not use the App.</p>

        <h2>2. Service Description</h2>
        <p>Conoce+ is a Salvadoran tourism platform designed to connect visitors with local tourism service providers.
            The App allows users to search and explore places, get routes, communicate via chat, and access advanced
            features through a subscription model.</p>

        <h2>3. Accounts and Registration</h2>
        <p>Access to most features requires creating an account.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tourist Users:</strong> Requires an email and password. Name and profile picture are optional.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Business Users:</strong> Requires the creation of a business profile which may include name,
                description, location, contact details, photos, logo, and other relevant information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and to keep
            it updated. You are solely responsible for the confidentiality of your password and for all activities that
            occur under your account.</p>

        <h2>4. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
        <p>The App operates on a "Freemium" model.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tourist Free Plan:</strong> Allows users to access all the content of the App with ads that
                allow us to monetize to cover expenses and maintenance of the platform.</li>
            <li><strong>Tourist Premium Plan:</strong> $3 USD/month or $20 USD/year. Includes ad removal and unlimited
                use of premium features such as map directions to places and businesses, as well as translation of
                messages and comments.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Free Plan:</strong> Allows businesses to have a basic presence on the platform with
                limited features, including registration for one business, two establishments and five products per
                establishment, ten photos for each one.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Premium Plan (“Conecta+”):</strong> $20 USD/month or $200 USD/year. Includes access to
                analytics, increased content capacity, and all tourist plan benefits.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Subscriptions are managed and billed through the payment services of the application store from which you
            downloaded the App (Google Play Billing for Android). You may cancel your subscription at any time through
            your account settings in said store. The cancellation will be effective at the end of the current billing
            cycle. No refunds will be provided for partial or unused subscription periods.</p>

        <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>Content generated by Users and Businesses (photos, text, etc.) remains their property. By uploading such
            content, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive license to display it within the App for the sole purpose of
            operating the platform. We will not use your intellectual property for external advertising without your
            explicit consent.</p>

            its courts, without prejudice to any mandatory consumer rights in your country of residence.</p>
